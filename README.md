# spirit_island_randomizer
 **Randomize the scenario, adversary, and spirit you'll play in a solo game of Spirit Island!**

## How to Use This
*Theoretically,* this should work, but Windows doesn't like me :(
1. Download the file
2. Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
3. Navigate to where the file is saved
4. Execute the script: script.js

## Upcoming Work
Eventually, I'll add HTML and CSS to make this easy-to-use and interactive, including:
+ Customizing what expansions to include
+ Specifying whether to play an easy, medium, or difficult game
+ Specifying a number of spirits
+ Randomizing the level of the adversary
